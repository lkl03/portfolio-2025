							copy="My passion for building websites began in childhood when I created a fan blog for the online game Club Penguin in 2012. At that time, website design wasn't nearly as widespread as it is today, but that early experience sparked a deep and lasting interest in the field. Over the years, I've progressed from mastering the fundamentals of Adobe Photoshop, HTML, and CSS to exploring advanced JavaScript and modern frameworks like ReactJS and NextJS. Eventually, I specialized in UI design, becoming proficient with industry-standard design tools such as Figma and Adobe XD. My development background, combined with my growing passion for design, allows me to engage fully across the entire creative processâ€”from conceptualizing ideas from scratch to bringing them to life in functional apps and websites."
